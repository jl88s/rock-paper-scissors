### Rock Paper Scissors

Second project on **The Odin Project** 
This was the second stepping stone in the unknown for me. Like literally. The process took longer than it should have. Since I lack algorithm skills and not being able to imagine how to structure the code in my head. It made things very difficult and frustrating. However, I decided to revert back into studying the basics from: reading different books along with blog posts, forums, Youtube, and other developers code logic, things started to come together. 

#### Getting Started



#### Deployment

For deployment, I used **Git** to track my changes between noticable milestones and/or heavy changes. The changes would then be updated to my **GitHub** account. After the project was completed, Netlify is my 'go-to' free web hosting service so I easily did their grad and drop and *poof* my game is online!

#### Skills used

I used a handful of basic skills in this project as I am still learning every time I write code. Learning the **Command Line** recently, it was a nice touch using the **Terminal** so I can showcase my skills and really put them to the test. I was comfortable and confident in my learnings by creating a local repository on **Git** and then being able to push them to **GitHub's** remote repository. It was a good feeling and seemed like this is a vital tool that every developer should be executing for all their projects. Though this project is a simple, recreating Google's landing page took me a good 4 hours total. After sitting on a blank page on **Visual Studio Code** I was very sure of the **HTML5** elements I was going to be using to visualize the *DOM*. With all the symantics in place the only thing left to do was to add 'life' to the page with good ol' **CSS3**. When replicating a webpage, it's important to have everything align to almost a T! Having a good sense of what *font-size*, *margin*, *color*, *padding*, etc the original desinger/developer used can spare you a great amount of time. With this, being able to use the web browser's **Inspector tool** allowed me to optimize the trail and error that would've been done without such great tool.
